Strategy 03 — Near-Miss Momentum
==================================
Same filter funnel as Strategy 01 (SMA Momentum) with two key improvements:

1. Near-miss promotion: stocks in the top 50 by rank that fail exactly ONE
   filter by at most 10% of its threshold are promoted to fill Top 15 slots.
   Higher-ranked near-misses always beat lower-ranked strict passes.

2. Hold-zone anti-whipsaw: a stock is only sold when it falls out of the
   top 25 eligible stocks (same near-miss rules). Normal rank fluctuation
   within the top 25 does not trigger a sell.

Parameters (from live screener config):
    MCap   > $500M
    ADV    > $10M
    Vol    < 80%  (0.8)
    RSI14  > 50
    52W high within 25%
    SMA21 buffer 5%
    CMF    > 0.05
    Portfolio size: 15
    Hold zone size: 25
